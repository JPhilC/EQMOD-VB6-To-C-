# EQMOD-VB6-To-C-
Somewhere to store rough conversions of the original EQASCOM VB6 code to C#.

The folder "eq-mod" contains the original EQMOD source code files. 
The solution eqmod\eqmod-ascom\EQMOD_ASCOM5.sln is the VB6 project file opened using VB Tools for Visual Studio.

The folder "eqmod_ascom_lite" contains a subset of the original eqascom VB6 files. This was used with the Mobilize.Net
VB6 to .NET migration tool demo version to create "eqmod_ascom_lite_.Net". The converted files helped me refactor the
EQMOD alignment model logic for inclusion in a stand-a-lone C# class library.
